# Calculator App

This project is created using TypeScript, React.js, and Next.js. The idea of this project is to create a frontend app with user authentication (login and register), JWT token management, and session handling for the user. All the actual calculations and operations are performed on a backend server, while the frontend app is responsible for displaying the information.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server locally :

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Live version

You can access the live version of the app at the following URL:

[https://truenorth-hector-ocampo-frontent-calculator.vercel.app/](https://truenorth-hector-ocampo-frontent-calculator.vercel.app/) in this url you find the live version of the app. 

In this app, you can register, login, and perform basic calculator operations. Each operation has a cost associated with it, and your balance decreases with each operation. When you register for the app, your balance is automatically set to 100. However, when your balance reaches zero, you won't be able to perform any more operations.
